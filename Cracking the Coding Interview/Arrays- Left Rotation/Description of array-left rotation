PROBLEM DESCRIPTION :
A left rotation operation on an array of size 1 shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left.
For example, if 3 left rotations are performed on array [1,2,3,4,5] , then the array would become [4,5,1,2,3] .

INPUT FORMAT:
Given an array of size "n" and let "k" be the number of left rotations to be performed (BOTH SEPARATED BY A SPACE).
Array is given in the second line.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print a single line of output of n sized array after performing rotation.

EXAMPLE:
5 3
[1,2,3,4,5]
o/p:
[4,5,1,2,3]
